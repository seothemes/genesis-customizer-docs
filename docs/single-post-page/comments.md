Comments can be enabled from **Settings > Discussion**.

The Genesis Customizer comments settings are located under the **Single Post /
Page**  panel because they are only shown on singular posts and pages. To
begin customizing the appearance of the comments area, navigate to
**Appearance > Customize > Genesis Customizer > Single Post / Page >
Comments**.

Comment styles are inherited from the existing page styles, so only minimal
settings are provided:
