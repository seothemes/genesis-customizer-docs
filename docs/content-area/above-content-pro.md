## Widget Area

The Above Content widget area is located above the main content area. It will
be located below the Below Header widget area if it is enabled. This area is
typically used for displaying banner ads, but can be used for many other
purposes.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5a03f50f2c7d3a272c0d866f/images/5cd158c62c7d3a177d6e6d46
