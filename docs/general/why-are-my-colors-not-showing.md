The most common reason for colors not showing is an opacity setting with a
value of 0. Adjust the opacity level of the color usually fixes the issue.

Genesis Customizer provides opacity controls in each color picker to allow you
to adjust the amount of transparency. The opacity level is highlighted in the
image below:

control and drag it to the top. This will increase the opacity level of the
color setting and your color should then become visible.
