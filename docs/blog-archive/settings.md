The Blog / Archive > Settings section provides a few settings for customizing
the appearance of blog and archive
pages.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5a03f50f2c7d3a272c0d866f/images/5cd3d6d704286306738ee863

## Colors

Currently there is only one color setting here. Other color settings can be
found in the other Customizer settings in the Blog / Archive panel.

The background color setting here changes the Body background color on blog
and archive pages only. This is useful if you want to have a different
background color for archives.

## Tip

Most of the blog and archive settings are provided by Genesis (the parent
theme). They can be found in the **Theme Settings > Content Archives** section
of the Customizer.
