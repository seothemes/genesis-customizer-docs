**Note:** Code added to the Custom CSS fields will be enqueued as a separate
file, unlike code added to the [Additional
CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/CSS#Custom_CSS_in_WordPress) section, which
is added as an inline style. Enqueuing the custom CSS in a separate file
improves performance by allowing it to be cached by the browser.

The Custom CSS section has 3 tabs, All, Mobile and Desktop. Code added to the
"All" tab will be applied to screen sizes of any size, code under the "Mobile"
tab will only be added to mobile devices and code under the "Desktop" tab will
be applied to desktop devices. Watch the video below for a quick
demonstration.
