The **Base Styles > Body** section contains settings which control the styling
of the body element. This usually applies to the base text.

## Colors

**Text**

The Text color is applied to the body element text. This applies to all text
elements on your site, however it is usually overridden by styles with a
higher priority. See the screenshot
