The **Base Styles > Links** section contains settings for styling anchor links
across your site.

## Colors

There are 2 color settings available here, **Text** and **Text Hover**. Text
controls the default link text color and Text Hover changes the color of links
when they are hovered by the cursor

## Text Decoration (underlines)

Links inherit the font settings from the parent element. The only typography
setting for links is the text decoration.
