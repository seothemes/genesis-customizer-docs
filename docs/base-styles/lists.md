The  **Base Styles > Lists** section contains settings for customizing the
style of lists elements inside the content area. Lists outside of the content
area will not be affected by these settings.

## List Style

The **Default Type** and **Default Position** settings allow you to change the
default style of list elements. Changing these is not usually recommended.
