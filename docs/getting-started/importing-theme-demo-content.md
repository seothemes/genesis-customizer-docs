## Steps to import demo content

Once the Genesis Customizer theme and it's plugin dependencies have been
installed and activated you will be redirected to the One Click Demo Import
screen:

From here, you can select a theme demo to import. Importing theme demo content
is optional and this step can be skipped if you wish to start from scratch.

Theme demos will not show the "Import" button if the required plugins are not
installed:

/file-lW7AUgbgwR.png)To enable these theme demos, first install the required
plugins. This will either be [Genesis Customizer
Pro](https://genesiscustomizer.com/pro/),
[Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) or [Beaver
Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/). Once the
required plugins are installed, the demos will become available to import.

To import a theme demo, click the **Import** button. This will open a popup
window, click **"Yes, import!"** and the demo import will begin. When the demo
import is finished you will see a success message with a link to view your
site:
