Before you begin setting up Genesis Customizer there are a some minimum
requirements that should first be met to ensure the theme setup runs smoothly.

## Genesis Framework

In order to use Genesis Customizer, you will first need to purchase a copy of
the [Genesis Framework from
StudioPress](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=346198&u=1459023&m=28169&urllink=&afftrack=).
The Genesis Framework is not included with Genesis Customizer.

## WordPress Version

We recommend that you update your site to the latest version of WordPress
before installing your theme. Whenever updating WordPress software, plugins,
or themes, be sure that your site has a backup.

## PHP Version

Genesis Customizer requires PHP version **5.4** or higher. To check your sites
PHP version, install and activate the [Display PHP
Version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-php-version/) plugin and then
navigate to the admin dashboard to check which PHP version your site is
running:
