Once you have successfully installed the Genesis Framework parent theme on
your site you are ready to begin installing the Genesis Customizer child
theme.

## 1\. Download

First, download a copy of the child theme from
[https://genesiscustomizer.com/](https://genesiscustomizer.com/checkout/?edd_action=add_to_cart&download_id=3378).
The basic version is free to download but you will need to follow the checkout
process. Once you have completed checkout you will have access to the Genesis
Customizer child theme in your account. Download the  **genesis-customizer-
theme.zip**  file and save it to your computer desktop:

  2. Click **Choose File**. Locate the **genesis-customizer-theme.zip** file that you downloaded and upload it.
  3. Click **Install Now** and wait for the theme to install.

**Activate** button.  

#### Please note: Activation usually takes around 30 seconds to 1 minute as it
automatically installs some required plugins in the background.

The plugin dependencies it installs are [Genesis
Customizer](https://github.com/seothemes/genesis-customizer) core/engine
plugin, [Kirki Toolkit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kirki/) for Customizer
settings and [One Click Demo Import](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-
demo-import/) for importing demo content.

After the theme is done installing the required plugins, you will be
redirected to the **One Click Demo Import** page and are ready to begin
setting up your theme.
