The Sticky Header module enables a fixed position or "sticky" header for your
site. To get started with the Sticky Header, navigate to **Header > Sticky
Header** and select which screen sizes it should be enabled on:

## Colors

By default, the sticky header will inherit the default colors from the Primary
Header and Primary Menu sections. There are more color settings provided for
the Sticky Header which will override the defaults, allowing you to set
different colors for the Sticky Header only:

## Different Logo

You may want to use a different logo for the sticky header only. To do this,
navigate to **Header > Sticky Header **in the Customizer and check the "Use
different logo for sticky header" option. Checking this option will open up
some more options for customizing the sticky header logo. These settings apply
to the Sticky Header logo only and do not affect the default logo:

when the header changes to sticky. See screen recording below as an example of
how it works.

First, set a default logo from the Site Identity section in the Customizer.
Refer to the [How to upload a custom
logo](https://docs.seothemes.com/article/227-how-to-upload-a-custom-logo)
article for further instructions. Once you have set the default logo, navigate
back to **Header > Sticky Header** and upload a different logo for the sticky
header. The sticky logo size and spacing can be adjusted from the logo
settings below the logo upload setting:

header on a specific page, navigate to the Edit Page screen for the page you
wish to edit. There will be a Genesis Customizer settings in the bottom right
of the screen. Check the "Disable sticky header" option and then click
