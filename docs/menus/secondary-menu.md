## Adding Menu Items

To add menu items to the Secondary Menu, navigate to **Appearance > Menus
**and either create a new menu or select an existing one. Begin adding items
from the left of the screen to the menu and click "Save" when you are done.
See the [How to create a navigation
menu](https://docs.seothemes.com/article/241-how-to-create-a-navigation-menu)
article for further instructions on how to add menu items to a menu.

Important: When creating the menu, be sure to check the Secondary Menu display
location under the Menu Settings:
