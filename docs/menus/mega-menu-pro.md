The Mega Menu module works by creating a new widget area called "Mega Menu".
This widget area can then be shown below a chosen menu item. To use the mega
menu, follow the steps below:

## 1\. Add Some Widgets

The first step of setting up the mega menu is to add some widgets to the Mega
Menu widget area. These can be anything you like, but for this demonstration
we will use Text and Navigation Menu widgets. To begin adding widgets,
navigate to **Appearance > Widgets** from the WordPress admin. You can add as
many widgets as you like, however it is recommended to use less than 4:

## 2\. Create Menu

The next step involves creating a new navigation menu. Navigate to
**Appearance > Menus** and create a new menu. You can name the menu anything
you like, and add as many menu items as necessary. The screen recording below
runs through the steps to create a new menu:

make sure that the Mega Menu checkbox is visible. To do this, expand the
Screen Options tab at the top of the window, and make sure the "Mega Menu"
option is checked. This will add a new option to each menu item. Check the
"Mega Menu" for the menu item which you want to display the mega menu below:

## 3\. Viewing the Mega Menu

Save the menu and navigate to the home page of your site. You will now see the
mega menu when hovering over the selected menu item:

**Note: Mobile devices**

Currently the mega menu only works on desktop screen sizes. There is a "Mobile
Menu" widget area that can be used for mobile devices instead of the mega
menu.
