## Adding Menu Items

To add menu items to the Primary Menu, navigate to Appearance > Menus and
either create a new menu or select an existing one. Begin adding items from
the left of the screen to the menu and click "Save" when you are done. See the

to-create-a-navigation-menu) article for further instructions on how to add
menu items to a menu.

**Important:** When creating the menu, be sure to check the Primary Menu
display location under the Menu Settings:
