The Mobile Menu refers to the responsive navigation menu that is displayed on
smaller devices. It automatically combines the Primary Menu and the Secondary
Menu (if one is set).

**Important** : The mobile menu will not be shown if the Primary Menu has not
been assigned.

## Mobile Menu Settings

There are a number of customization settings provided for the mobile menu
area, including Colors, Typography, Menu Item spacing and alignment.

## Widget Area (requires Pro)

There is no Customizer section added for the Mobile Menu widget area as it
inherits most of its styling from the Mobile Menu settings under  **Menus >
Mobile Menu**.
